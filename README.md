In this project, I tried to use the Pillow library to make captcha

To create a random image consisting of 6 numbers and letters, you can call "captcha_generator()".

and to creat a mathematical captcha you can use "mathematical_captcha()".

This method make an image consisting of a random addition and subtraction mathematical operation.

exams: "path" takes a string for the name and direction of the PNG file "size" has a default tuple value you can also change it

mathematical_captcha(path, size)
